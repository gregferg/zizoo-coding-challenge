## Zizoo coding challenge

I've spent quite some time on this and unfortunately do not have the extra hours required to finish it as I have other coding challenges to complete. I would estimate this [https://github.com/zizooboats/frontend-code-challenge] (coding challenge) (if done correctly), to take easily two-three weeks. Especially considering all the React/HTML/CSS/Testing and test data is being created from scratch and everything has to be set up for the first time. Also making sure that testing is well done for the various parts of the component and the various desktop/mobile browsers and their potential various renderings (if the boat is recommended or not, partial review stars, ie 80% good reviews would be 4.5 stars full, while 90% would be 4.7, etc, etc).

I was not able to make it responsive (would have done with CSS media queries), nor was I able to finish the styling for Desktop, though it's almost there.

Anyways hope you can get a basic understanding of my skills from what I have been able to put together in the time I had! And have a nice day :)
